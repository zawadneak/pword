## :fire: Inspiration

This app was inspired by a [**project listed in the app ideas github page by florinpop17**](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas). The password generator project can be seen [here](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/2-Intermediate/Password-Generator.md).

With this inspiration, I decided to develop this app in a language and tech that I'm still learning: [_Flutter_](https://flutter.dev/).

This app was published in [_Google Play Store_](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lcdev.pword)
